## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/apatheia.git
cd apatheia

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally.
Create a new database manually (e.g., apatheia_dev).

### 3. Install Dependencies
Backend
- cd server
- npm install

Frontend
- cd client
- npm install

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
In the server directory, create a .env file:

DB_NAME=apatheia_dev  
DB_USER=your_db_username  
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password  
DB_HOST=localhost  
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret  

Update these values with your PostgreSQL credentials and a JWT secret.


#### 🌱 Seed the Database
To populate the app with sample data, run:
- cd server
- npm run seed

This will create:

A test user:  
Username: testuser  
Password: testpassword  

Five quotes (three dated in the past, each with a journal entry).

#### ⚙️ Usage
Start the Backend Server
- cd server
- npm run dev
  
Start the Frontend Client
In a separate terminal:
- cd client
- npm run dev
The app should now be running at: http://localhost:5173
